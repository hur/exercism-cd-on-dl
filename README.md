# Shell function to automatically cd to downloaded exercism exercise

## Installation:

First, `git clone https://github.com/hur/exercism-cd-on-dl.git`. Then, add `source path/to/exercism-cd-on-dl/exercism-dl.sh` to your `.bashrc` or equivalent, OR copy and paste the contents of the file into your `.bashrc` or equivalent.

e.g. `echo "source path/to/exercism-cd-on-dl/exercism-dl.sh >> ~/.bashrc"`
(Remember to use the actual path where you cloned the repo)

## Usage:

Use `exercism-dl` instead of `exercism download` (with the necessary arguments) to automatically switch to the created directory upon download.
